Hello, I'm Eddie, a Maths and Computer Science student at [Queen's University Belfast][qub]. I've made this website to post some small Maths and Computer Science projects that I'm working on. I'm not sure how regular my posts will be, but stay tuned if you're keen on either Maths or Computer Science.
